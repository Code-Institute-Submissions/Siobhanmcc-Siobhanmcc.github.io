## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section  

1. I am a recruiter looking to find information about Siobhan's background. On arriving at the site, I am greeted by a menu of "About", "Skills", "Projects","Contact". If I take the first option, and go straight to the "About" section, I am given the option to download a copy of Siobhan's resume. Should I wish to explore them, there are also options to visit Siobhan's Linkedin and Github in this section. 

2. I am a potential employer looking to find out what skills Siobhan has as well as what projects she has worked on previously. I can see these by visiting the "Skills" section on her site. I can then click on "Projects" to see what projects she has worked on previously & visit these sites by clicking on the images available.
